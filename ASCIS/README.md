This is a writeup in one of the biggest CTF in my country which called ASCIS (ASEAN Student Contest on Information Security). But in the 2016-2019 we called this is SVATTT instead of ASCIS, so there's a different in a flag format here.

- 2016-2019: flag format is SVATTT + %Year_of_ctf% + {}, ex: 2016 is SVATTT2016{}
- 2020 to the latest years: ASCIS{}
